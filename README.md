# Advent of Code
This repository will contain all the exercises from [2023 AoC event](https://adventofcode.com/2023) resolved by me! (*hopefully*)

I'll try to solve them in Rust or Golang or C++, mainly Rust.

## Previous AoC
I never partecipated during the past years, I'll probably post more of them with time too!
